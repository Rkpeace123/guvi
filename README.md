AURORA
Ultimate Agentic Honeypot
The AI That Thinks Like a Victim. Acts Like a Detective.

India is losing thousands of crores every year to scams.

Not because people are careless.
But because scammers have become smarter.

They don’t shout anymore.
They build trust.
They speak politely.
They use mixed language.
They manipulate emotions.

AURORA was built to fight back.

Not by blocking.
Not by reacting.
But by engaging.

💡 What is AURORA?

AURORA is an autonomous AI-powered honeypot system designed to:

• Detect scam intent using multi-layer intelligence
• Converse like a real human
• Extract scammer infrastructure
• Convert conversations into structured evidence

It doesn’t just detect scams.
It dismantles scam networks.

🧠 How It Works

When a suspicious message arrives:

Triangulation Detection Engine

Pattern signals

Intent classification

Behavioral scoring

Emotional manipulation detection

Human-like Engagement Agent

Mirrors tone and grammar

Adapts to Hinglish / informal style

Maintains persona consistency

Strategically asks extraction questions

Intelligence Extraction Engine

Phone numbers

UPI IDs

Bank accounts

Links

Email addresses

Structured Intelligence Output

JSON formatted

Ready for law enforcement

Network-level analysis capable

All within ~2 seconds per message.

🔍 What Makes AURORA Different?

• Ensemble detection (multi-model voting)
• Zero-shot adaptation to new scam patterns
• Mirror-based conversational strategy
• Infrastructure-level intelligence mapping
• Designed specifically for Indian scam patterns (UPI, +91, cultural cues)

This is not another keyword filter.

This is an AI counter-offensive.
